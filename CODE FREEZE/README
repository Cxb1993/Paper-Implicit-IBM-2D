This is the code used to generate the results for the paper "Effcient solutions to robust, semi-implicit discretizations of the Immersed Boundary Method".

This code is disorganized and it will never get better. It has been purposefully frozen at the time of the writing of this paper.

Don't read it, don't look at it, and especially don't use it unless absolutely necessary.

A cleaned-up version of this code, intended for reading, looking, and using, can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/JordanFisher/Implicit-Immersed-Boundary.

In the event of apocalypse and GitHub ceased to exist but somehow you still found this repo, please contact the author at jordan.efisher@gmail.com.
